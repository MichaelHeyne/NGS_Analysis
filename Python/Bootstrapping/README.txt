Short description:
    Bootstrapping.py: A python script to run a bootstrapping analysis for a list found mutations and sequence counts representing a population.
    
System requirements
    - a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations
    - Python 3.7
  
 Installation guide:
    - No installation needed
    
 Demo:
    - Define the variables InputFile (list of single mutants and sequence counts for each single mutant) and OutputFile. Run the code.
    - The expected output is a list of mutants containing the measured frequency, the mean frequency determined by the bootstrapping algorithm, the standard deviation and the 95% confidence interval standard deviation for each single mutant.
    - expected run time: several minutes

Instructions for use:
    - Download the sample data. Define the variables InputFile and OutputFile determining the path of the input file and the output file, respectively. Run the code.
