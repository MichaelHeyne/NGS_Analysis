Short description:
    A Matlab script to count the number of sequences of each single BPTI mutation in a FASTQ file.
    
System requirements:
    - a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations
    - MATLAB (tested on version R2016B)
  
 Installation guide:
    - No installation needed
    
 Demo:
    - The main file is DataAnalysisBPTI.m
    - Here you can change the paths of the input (a fastq file, variable name: na) and output files (an excel list, variable name: filename)
    - Run the code in Matlab
    - Expected output: An excel list showing all single mutants of BPTI and their sequence counts in the input fastq file
    - Expected run time: ~30 min for 300,000 sequences in a fastq file

Instructions for use:
    - Use the fastq files stored in the dataverse: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IA4LAR
    - Run the steps mentioned above
